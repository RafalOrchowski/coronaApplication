This application displays number of COVID-19 cases in given day by country using very simple UI.

Application fetches data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv

Then it parses it and shows in table.
